# Calendar

_Note_: If you are having trouble viewing the calendars below and are using Safari, we suggest switching to an alternate browser (like Chrome). Alternatively, you can go to Safari settings and switch "Prevent cross-site tracking" off, or you can see the calendar [here](TBDLink){:target="\_blank"}.


The below calendar shows times for lecture, discussion, office hours, and exams/extra review sessions.
<!--In-person office hours are in <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span>, click on each event to see which GSI and/or reader is running each office hour time. --> You should come to these with questions about anything â€“ projects, multivitamins, concepts, etc. 

**Note: Office hours for course staff will be held in-person in TBD; Prof. Parameswaran's office hours will be held
in person in South Hall 212.**
