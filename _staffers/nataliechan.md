Hi, I'm Natalie! :D I'm a senior studying data science and economics. In my free time, I love exploring new bakeries & cafes, making jewelry, and imagining my ideal animal crossing town. This is my 6th semester teaching in the Data Science Department (I've been on staff for Data 8 and 100!) and 2nd time teaching Data 101, and I'm super excited to meet y'all this semester! âœ¨
